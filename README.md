## Description ##
This is a Pokedex App created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The app uses asynchronous programming with the Pokemon API, including fetch and promises. 
The aim of the project was to learn vanilla JavaScript with the basics of variables, arrays, objects, functions, IFEE and how to integrate a UI component with Bootstrap like a modal and navbar
.
